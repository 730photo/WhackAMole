# WhackAMole

<h5>
This was the 30th project from the #JavaScript30 that i've completed. I built a Whack-A-Mole game. When you see a mole arise from the firt, you only have a split second to click(bonk) it and if you click on it before it goes back in the dirt, you get a point. You can restart the game by pressing the start button.
